7. Add Friend functionality
NOTE: Other user will receive the friend request only when he logs in
Send friend req:
    If other user DOESN'T have an account:
    *-tell user if other user doesnt have an account
   
    It other user has an account:AA
    *-send friend request and store it in friend_requests table
    -server will try to send the message
    NOT WORKING:-if other user is online:
            -he will receive the friend-request, 
                    and the message will be deleted from DB
    *-if other user is NOT online:
            *-message will be kept in DB
            *-when he signs in, check if he has any 
                    messages to receive, server will send that message

    -check if friend you try to add is not already in your friends list
